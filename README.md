## 👩‍💻 About Me  

I am a **detail-oriented Quality Assurance Engineer** with hands-on experience in **manual and automated testing** for web, ERP, and enterprise applications. I have a strong understanding of the **software development and testing life cycles (SDLC/STLC)** and enjoy working closely with cross-functional teams to deliver high-quality, reliable software.

I am skilled in **functional, regression, UI, and API testing**, with experience using tools such as **Selenium WebDriver, Postman, and JUnit**. With a solid foundation in **Java, JavaScript, and modern development frameworks**, I bridge the gap between development and quality assurance to improve testing efficiency and product quality.
